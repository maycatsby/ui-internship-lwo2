                <h2>Grumpy cat is dead</h2>
                <p>
                    San Francisco (CNN Business)Grumpy Cat — the angry-looking celebrity feline who launched countless
                    internet memes — died on Tuesday. The beloved cat leaves behind her owner Tabatha Bundesen, a small
                    empire of books and merchandise bearing her unique face, movie and TV appearances, and millions of
                    Google hits. Grumpy Cat is also likely to live on in one particular area of technology: artificial
                    intelligence. Images spread across the internet are often collected by researchers and used to train
                    artificial intelligence algorithms to do tasks like recognize people or animals in images, or even
                    learn how to generate wholly new images of people or animals.

                <h2>Fattest cat</h2>
                <p>
                    In previous editions of the Guinness World Records book, the editors recorded heaviest animals and
                    pets. The heaviest cat of all, for example, was Himmy, owned by Thomas Vyse (Australia), who weighed
                    21.3kg (46lb 15 ½ oz) when it died on 12th March 1986 at the age of 10 years 4 months.

                </figure>
                <p>
                    Himmy – who had to be transported in a wheelbarrow – was thankfully unchallenged until 1998, when
                    editors and record managers decided to discontinue the category to deter people from over-feeding
                    their pets just to appear in the book. Today, we still monitor animal weight and size by breed –
                    such as the largest breed of horse – but not individual specimens.

                <h2>Most views for a cat on YouTube</h2>
                <p>
                    Full of character and sublimely lazy, Maru is the most viewed cat on YouTube. His name means “round”
                    in Japanese, and it’s partly his tubbiness that has won the Scottish fold cat so many fans.
